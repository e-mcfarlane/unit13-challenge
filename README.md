# unit13-challenge - RoboAdvisor Bot


## RoboAdvisor Bot

In this activity, I:
<ul>
  <li> Built a roboAdvisor bot that took in Name, Age, investment amount, and risk level (I had to create a custom slot to account for risk level).
  <li> Built a lambda function to validate age & investment amount, then return a mix of equities based on risk level.
  <li> Recorded the bot in action
